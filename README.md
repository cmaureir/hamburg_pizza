# Hamburg Python Pizza :snake:

## A dive into CPython

This repository contains the material of the talk.
The first two directories highlight the two main examples,
while the third is a quick start on creating a new simple Python module
in C:

* `debug_cpython`, simple guide to start debugging the internals of a simple
  python script.
* `list_ask_play`, this contains the patch that you can apply to the CPython
  repository, to get the same functionality of the live coding example.
* `hello_world_cpython`, this example was not shown during the presentation,
  but it could be the starting point of creating your own Python modules in
  pure CPython.

## What is all this about?
